    <h1>About Canterbury</h1>
    <p>Canterbury's history is marked by both pre-European Māori settlement and the later organized European 
        colonization by the Canterbury Association. The region was first inhabited by Māori, 
         the Ngāi Tahu tribe, who used its resources for centuries. In the mid-19th century, 
         the Canterbury Association, led by John Robert Godley, established a planned colony with Christchurch as 
         its capital. The colony aimed to create a hierarchical English society with the Anglican Church at its 
         center. 
Māori History:
Pre-European Settlement:
Māori tribes, including the Ngāi Tahu, arrived in Canterbury long before European colonization. They utilized the 
region's resources, particularly around wetlands and along the coast, and established pā (fortified villages) and 
fishing grounds. 
Ngāi Tahu:
The Ngāi Tahu were the main Māori tribe in Canterbury and had a strong connection to the land, including the 
plains and the coastline. They were deeply familiar with the region's resources and had a long history of
 interacting with the environment. 
Land Acquisition:
The Canterbury Association, in its plan for European settlement, needed to acquire land from Māori tribes, 
including the Ngāi Tahu. This process led to significant changes in land ownership and Māori communities. 
European Colonization:
Canterbury Association:
The Canterbury Association, founded in England, aimed to establish a planned colony in New Zealand, 
with Canterbury as its location. The plan was to create a society based on English models, with a hierarchical 
structure and the Anglican Church as a central institution. 
Christchurch:
Christchurch, the capital of Canterbury, was named after Christ Church, Oxford, where John Robert Godley, a key 
figure in the Canterbury Association, had studied. The city was designed with tree-lined streets and a focus on a 
planned community. 
Lyttelton:
The port of Lyttelton, located on the coast, was also established as part of the Canterbury settlement and became a 
major hub for trade and transportation. 
Sheep Farming:
Canterbury became known for its sheep farming, with large sheep runs established on the plains and in the hill
 country. 
University of Canterbury:
The University of Canterbury, formerly Canterbury College, was established in 1873, becoming only the second
 university in New Zealand. 
Key Figures:
John Robert Godley:
Known as the founder of Canterbury, Godley was a key figure in the Canterbury Association and played a crucial role
 in planning the colony and its capital, Christchurch. 
Edward Gibbon Wakefield:
Wakefield's ideas on organized colonization influenced the planning of the Canterbury settlement. 
Canterbury's Modern Identity:
"The Garden City":
Christchurch, the main city in Canterbury, is known as "the garden city" due to its tree-lined streets and natural
 beauty.
Cultural Activities:
Canterbury has a rich cultural history, with art, music, and theatrical activities flourishing in the region.
Christchurch Earthquakes:
The 2010 and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes caused significant damage to the city and region, but it has since undergone a period of rebuilding and renewal.</p>
