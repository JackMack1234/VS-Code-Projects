    <h1>About Canterbury</h1>
    <p> Canterbury, New Zealand, has a rich history shaped by Māori settlement, European colonization, 
        and agricultural development. </p>

<p>The Early Māori Period <br>
The earliest settlers in Canterbury were the Moa-hunters, arriving around the 14th century. 
They left traces of their presence in burial sites near river mouths and valleys. 
Later, the Waitaha people occupied the region, followed by Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāi Tahu, who became 
the dominant iwi (tribe) in the South Island. Māori communities thrived near food sources, particularly around
 Te Waihora (Lake Ellesmere), which was abundant in eels.</p>

<p> European Settlement and the Canterbury Association <br>
European settlement began in the 1840s, with the Canterbury Association—a London-based group—establishing a 
structured colony in 1850. Their goal was to recreate English rural society, bringing settlers from different
 social classes, including landowners, farmers, and laborers. The settlers established large sheep farms, 
 which became the backbone of Canterbury’s economy. </p>

<p> Agricultural Growth and Economic Development <br>
Sheep farming flourished, with Canterbury becoming famous for its Canterbury lamb exports.
 By the late 19th century, large farms were divided into smaller holdings, allowing more settlers to participate in 
 agriculture. The region’s vast plains and braided rivers supported farming and irrigation, making Canterbury one 
 of New Zealand’s most productive agricultural areas. </p>

 <p> Christchurch and Regional Development <br>
Christchurch, the largest city in Canterbury, developed as a cultural and economic hub. Known as “the garden city,” 
it features tree-lined streets and the Avon River. The city has been home to many creative minds, including artists,
 poets, and writers. However, the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes dramatically reshaped Christchurch, leading to extensive
  rebuilding efforts. </p>
<p>Modern Canterbury <br>
Today, Canterbury remains a vital part of New Zealand’s economy, with strong agricultural, tourism, and 
educational sectors. The region’s stunning landscapes, from the Southern Alps to Banks Peninsula, 
continue to attract visitors and residents alike. </p>
